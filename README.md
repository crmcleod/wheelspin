# Wheelspin - A random item picker in the style of a car race 🏎

### Objective
Create a fun, aesthetically interesting alternative to the free, advert-laden, random name-picking wheels.
* The user should be able to rerun the runners-up and edit the list after each 'pick'
* There should be an element of suspense in the lead up to the result
* There should be some celebratory animation on picking

### Deployment
[Demo available here!](https://crmcleod.github.io/wheelspin/)

### Technology
* React
